# ETL Banking Transactions Combined Pipeline Project

## Project Summary
This is an enterprise-style combined pipeline ETL project built on a large messy banking transaction dataset (154k+ rows) designed to simulate real-world financial data complexity.

The purpose of this case study is to perform end-to-end ETL across multiple tools — proving full pipeline capability from raw ingestion to analytical intelligence.

## What I will be doing
- Ingest raw dirty CSV dataset into Excel
- Perform aggressive data cleansing (types, formats, missing values, splits, deduping)
- Export curated / cleansed data into MySQL Workbench
- Build SQL queries for fraud-risk analysis & model-style numeric scoring
- Connect Power BI directly to MySQL database
- Build advanced dashboards with multi-region segmentation

## Tools in this pipeline
| Stage | Tool | Purpose |
|-------|------|----------|
| Extract / Transform | Excel | Raw dirty data → structured cleaned dataset |
| Load / Warehouse | MySQL Workbench | Persistent storage / querying layer |
| Analytics Layer | Power BI | Visualization, risk analytics & insights |

## Project Goal
To demonstrate that I can operate across the entire data lifecycle — not only analysis, but **complete ETL pipeline orchestration** — which matches the work of modern banking & insurance analytics teams.

## Short Description (for README or Website)
Data Validation & Setup SQL Script
This script includes essential SQL queries used to verify, clean, and prepare the imported banking transactions dataset. It ensures table integrity, correct schema structure, and data accuracy before connecting the database to Power BI for dashboard development.

---

## Optional Extended Line (for website project section)
This SQL query file was created to perform database validation, rename tables, check column data types, and run accuracy checks before building the Power BI dashboard. It acts as the foundation of the entire ETL and analysis process.

## Website/Portfolio Description Snippet
> Enterprise-grade, end-to-end ETL banking transactions combined pipeline project. I engineered the entire flow myself — from raw ingestion to curated warehouse and downstream BI visualization. This showcases full-stack data engineering + analytics capability in a single unified pipeline (Excel → MySQL → Power BI) with fraud-risk scoring, merchant category intelligence, and country-wise transaction segmentation — high-scale, multi-tool pipeline work that directly aligns with real banking & insurance analytics environments.
