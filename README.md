# ETL Banking Transactions Combined Pipeline Project

## Project Summary
This is an enterprise-style combined pipeline ETL project built on a large messy banking transaction dataset (154k+ rows) designed to simulate real-world financial data complexity.

The purpose of this case study is to perform end-to-end ETL across multiple tools — proving full pipeline capability from raw ingestion to analytical intelligence.

## What I will be doing
- Ingest raw dirty CSV dataset into Excel
- Perform aggressive data cleansing (types, formats, missing values, splits, deduping)
- Export curated / cleansed data into MySQL Workbench
- Build SQL queries for fraud-risk analysis & model-style numeric scoring
- Connect Power BI directly to MySQL database
- Build advanced dashboards with multi-region segmentation

## Tools in this pipeline
| Stage | Tool | Purpose |
|-------|------|----------|
| Extract / Transform | Excel | Raw dirty data → structured cleaned dataset |
| Load / Warehouse | MySQL Workbench | Persistent storage / querying layer |
| Analytics Layer | Power BI | Visualization, risk analytics & insights |

## Project Goal
To demonstrate that I can operate across the entire data lifecycle — not only analysis, but **complete ETL pipeline orchestration** — which matches the work of modern banking & insurance analytics teams.

## Website/Portfolio Description Snippet
> Enterprise-grade, end-to-end ETL banking transactions combined pipeline project. I engineered the entire flow myself — from raw ingestion to curated warehouse and downstream BI visualization. This showcases full-stack data engineering + analytics capability in a single unified pipeline (Excel → MySQL → Power BI) with fraud-risk scoring, merchant category intelligence, and country-wise transaction segmentation — high-scale, multi-tool pipeline work that directly aligns with real banking & insurance analytics environments.
